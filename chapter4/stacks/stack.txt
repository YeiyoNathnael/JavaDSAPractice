Stack
Definition: an ordered group of homogenous items.
The removal of existing items and the addition of new ones can only take place on the top of the stack.

Operations: 

- Push : adds to the top of the stack.
- Pop : takes the top element off the stack. 
- MakeEmpty : makes the stack empty.
- IsEmpty : checks if the stack is empty.
- IsFull : checks if the stack is full.
- Top : returns a copy of the top element.

Note:
I will be attempting to implement the following featues using java, and do some algorithms related to stacks.
