Recursive call: a method call in which the method being called is the same as the one making it.


Recursion can be direct, where a method directly calls itself, or indirectly, where achain of two or more method calls return to the original calling method.

Key Ideas in recursion: 
------------------------------------------
- Base Case(Anchor)
- General Case (recursive case) 
- Recursive algorithm


Finding a recursive solution:
-------------------------------------------
- Each successive recursive call should bring you closer to a well known state.
- That state is cakked base case, and can be expressed without need for recursion.
- Each recursive algorithm must have at least one base case as well as a general case.
- The general format for many recursive functions look as such:

	if( some case for a known state) // base case
		solution statement
	else				 // general case
		recursive function call  // recursion step


Three-Question Method of verifying recursive functions:
----------------------------------------------

✓ Base-Case Question : Is there a non-recursive way out of the function?
✓ Smaller-Case Question: Does each recursive function involve a smaller case of the original problem.
✓ General-Case Question: Assuming each recursion works, does the whole function work correctly?
